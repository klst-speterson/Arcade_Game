# Arcade Game
This is a project from lesson 4 of Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree. For this project I used object-oriented programming to create a new version of the arcade game Frogger.


## Instructions
This is a fun frogger game where your objective is to move the Player across the screen to the water *while avoiding the enemy*!  You will use the **arrow** keys on your keyboard to move the player. If you hit an enemy or make it to the water you will reset the player to the bottom of the sceen. 

## Deployment
To begin playing the game you will open the index.html file in your browser.

## Languages used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
