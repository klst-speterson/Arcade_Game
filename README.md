===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# Classic Arcade Game: Frogger
This is a fun frogger game where your objective is to move the Player across the screen to the water *while avoiding the enemy*!  You will use the **arrow** keys on your keyboard to move the player. If you hit an enemy or make it to the water you will reset the player to the bottom of the sceen (the location will vary). 

## Deployment
To begin playing the game you will open the index.html file in your browser.
